Project Description:
Developed a deep learning model using DCGAN architecture to generate synthetic images of handwritten digits, similar to those in the MNIST dataset. The project involved building and training two neural networks — a generator and a discriminator — that competed against each other to produce increasingly realistic digit images.

Key Responsibilities:

• Designed and implemented the DCGAN model architecture using TensorFlow/Keras.

• Preprocessed and normalized the MNIST dataset for optimal model training.

• Trained the generator to produce realistic handwritten digits while improving the discriminator's ability to distinguish real from fake images.

• Tuned hyperparameters such as learning rates, batch sizes, and activation functions to enhance model performance.

• Visualized the training progress by generating sample outputs at different epochs.

• Evaluated the model using qualitative analysis of generated images.

Skills Gained:

→ Deep Learning

→ Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

→ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

→ Python Programming (TensorFlow/Keras)

→ Data Preprocessing and Visualization

→ Model Evaluation and Tuning
